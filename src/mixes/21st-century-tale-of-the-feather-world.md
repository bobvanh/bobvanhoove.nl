This recording was centered around "21st century blues" by Lo:rise, aiming to find a nice surrounding for that track. Gave it another listen and decided it's worth a share.

I was kindly given permission by Marsha to use her artwork for the cover image, she makes some beautiful stuff. Find her on Instagram at [marshasartfuelledlife](https://www.instagram.com/marshasartfuelledlife/)
