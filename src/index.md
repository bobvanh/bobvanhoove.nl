WiP :)

For starters I wanted to archive my dj [mixes](/mixes) that I used to offer via
[mixcloud.com](https://www.mixcloud.com/bvh/). Expect electro, techno, and 
house with sprinkles of acid.

I took a break from mixing as I noticed my listening habits were changing, 
gravitating more towards hypnotic african grooves and jazzy crossovers. To keep
up with dj-ing requires spending many hours digging for those special tracks 
and for now I rather spend that time discovering what other music the world has
to offer.
